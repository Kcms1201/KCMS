## ❌ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Only One Club Selected at a Time**

**Symptom:** When you click a second club, the first one gets deselected.

**Cause:** Not holding `Ctrl` key.

**Solution:** 
- **MUST hold** `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (Mac) **BEFORE** clicking
- Keep holding while clicking each club
- Only release after all selections made

---

### **Issue 2: Can't Deselect a Club**

**Symptom:** Clicking a highlighted club doesn't deselect it.

**Cause:** Not holding `Ctrl` key.

**Solution:**
- Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd`)
- Click the highlighted club
- It should deselect

---

### **Issue 3: Selection Not Saving**

**Symptom:** Clubs selected but not saved to database.

**Cause:** Form submission issue.

**Debug:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab (F12) for POST/PATCH request
3. Verify `participatingClubs` in request payload:
```javascript
// In Network tab → Payload
participatingClubs: ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
```

---

### **Issue 4: Dropdown Not Showing Clubs**

**Symptom:** Empty dropdown or only shows primary club.

**Cause:** Clubs not loaded.

**Debug:**
1. Check console for:
```javascript
✅ All clubs for dropdown: Array(0)  // ❌ Problem!
```

2. Verify backend response:
```javascript
// Should return clubs array
{ status: "success", data: { clubs: [...] } }
```

## 📊 Debug Mode

I've added console logging to both pages:

### **CreateEventPage:**
```javascript
✅ CreateEvent - Selected clubs: [...]
📊 CreateEvent - Number selected: X
```

### **EditEventPage:**
```javascript
✅ Selected clubs: [...]
📊 Number of clubs selected: X
```

**These logs appear EVERY TIME you click!**

If you don't see logs → Dropdown not working  
If logs show wrong array → Selection logic issue  
If logs correct but data not saved → Submit logic issue

## 🚀 Advanced: Keyboard Shortcuts

## ✅ Success Indicators

## 📞 Still Not Working?

If after all tests it's still not working:

1. **Check if holding Ctrl properly**
   - Try with one hand on Ctrl, other on mouse
   - Make sure you press Ctrl BEFORE clicking

2. **Try different browser**
   - Test in Chrome first
   - If works in Chrome but not Firefox → browser issue

3. **Check CSS**
   - Multi-select might be styled to look like single-select
   - Look for `size="5"` in dropdown (should show 5 items)

4. **Verify React state**
   - Use React DevTools
   - Check `selectedParticipatingClubs` state
   - Should be an array: `["id1", "id2"]`
