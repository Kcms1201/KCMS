# ✅ VERIFIED: ALL Club Members Tracked (Not Just Core)

## 🎯 Confirmation

**Question:** Are regular members included in attendance tracking?

**Answer:** ✅ YES - ALL approved members, regardless of role!

---

## 📋 Code Proof

### **Event Service - Attendance Creation**

**File:** `event.service.js` (Lines 45-48)

```javascript
const clubMembers = await Membership.find({
  club: { $in: allClubIds },
  status: 'approved'  // ✅ Only checks status, NOT role!
}).lean();
```

**Who Gets Tracked:**
- ✅ Regular members (role: 'member')
- ✅ Core members (role: 'core')
- ✅ Vice presidents (role: 'vicePresident')
- ✅ Presidents (role: 'president')

**NO role filtering!**

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### **Promotion Scenario:**

**Without regular member tracking:**
```
Regular Member → (works at events) → No data recorded
                                    ↓
                            Can't evaluate for promotion ❌
```

**With regular member tracking (current):**
```
Regular Member → (works at events) → Attendance recorded ✅
                                    ↓
                            Analytics show participation ✅
                                    ↓
                            Evaluate for promotion ✅
                                    ↓
                            Promote to Core based on data ✅
```

## 🧪 Quick Verification Test

### **After creating an event:**

**MongoDB Query:**
```javascript
// Count attendance records
db.attendances.countDocuments({ 
  event: ObjectId("EVENT_ID"),
  type: "organizer"
})

// Count approved members
db.memberships.countDocuments({
  club: { $in: [CLUB_IDS] },
  status: "approved"
})

// ✅ These two counts should be EQUAL!
// Proves ALL members are tracked, not just core
```
