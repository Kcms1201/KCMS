## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue 1: "Create Recruitment" Button Not Visible**
**Cause:** User doesn't have president/core role  
**Fix:** 
```javascript
// Check user roles
console.log(user.clubRoles);
// Should include: { clubId: 'xxx', roles: ['president'] }

// If missing, admin needs to assign role:
POST /api/clubs/:clubId/members
Body: { userId: 'xxx', role: 'president' }
```

---

### **Issue 2: Cannot Apply to Recruitment**
**Cause:** User already applied OR recruitment not open  
**Fix:**
```javascript
// Check recruitment status
GET /api/recruitments/:id
// Status should be 'open'

// Check existing application
GET /api/recruitments/:id/applications
// Filter by current user
```

---

### **Issue 3: Applications Not Showing**
**Cause:** Wrong club context OR no applications yet  
**Fix:**
- Verify you're viewing correct recruitment
- Check applications count > 0
- Ensure logged in as president/core of that club

---

### **Issue 4: Date Validation Error**
**Cause:** Start date in past OR end date before start  
**Fix:**
```javascript
startDate: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // Tomorrow
endDate: new Date(Date.now() + 8 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 8 days later
```
