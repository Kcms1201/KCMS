# ✅ FINAL FIX COMPLETE!

## What Was Fixed

**File:** `Frontend/src/services/authService.js`

**Issue:** Frontend was looking for `accessToken` but backend returns `token`

**Fix:** Changed line 14 from:
```javascript
if (response.data.data.accessToken) {
  localStorage.setItem('tempToken', response.data.data.accessToken);
}
```

To:
```javascript
if (response.data.data.token) {
  localStorage.setItem('tempToken', response.data.data.token);
}
```
