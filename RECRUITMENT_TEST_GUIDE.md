## 🔍 DEBUGGING CHECKS

### **Check 1: Browser Console Logs**

**Look for these logs:**
```javascript
// On form submission:
📤 Creating recruitment with data: {
  "club": "67xxxxx...",  // ✅ Should be valid ObjectId
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "startDate": "2025-10-28",
  "endDate": "2025-10-31",
  "customQuestions": []
}

// On success:
✅ Recruitment created successfully: { data: {...} }

// On error:
❌ Error creating recruitment: Error {...}
Error response: { message: "..." }
```

**If you see an error:**
- Check `Error response:` for backend error message
- Copy the error and share it for debugging

---

### **Check 2: Backend Terminal Logs**

**Backend should show:**
```
POST /api/recruitments 201 - 234ms
[Audit] RECRUITMENT_CREATE by user 67xxxxx
```

**If you see 400 error:**
```
POST /api/recruitments 400 - 45ms
Validation error: {...}
```
- This means validation failed
- Check which field failed in the error message

---

### **Check 3: Network Tab**

**In Browser DevTools:**
1. Go to **Network** tab
2. Filter: XHR or Fetch
3. Submit recruitment
4. Click on `recruitments` request
5. Check **Payload** tab

**Should show:**
```json
{
  "club": "67xxxxx...",
  "title": "Test Recruitment 2024",
  "description": "This is a test...",
  "startDate": "2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z",
  "endDate": "2025-10-31T00:00:00.000Z",
  "customQuestions": []
}
```

**Check:**
- ✅ `club` field present and NOT empty string
- ✅ `club` is valid ObjectId format (24 hex chars)
- ✅ All required fields present

---

## ❌ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue 1: "Club is required" error still appears**

**Possible causes:**
1. Frontend changes not loaded (hard refresh needed)
2. Club dropdown not loading clubs
3. Club ID is empty string

**Fix:**
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl + Shift + R  (Chrome/Edge)
Cmd + Shift + R   (Mac)

# Or clear cache
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cache → Reload
```

---

### **Issue 2: Clubs not appearing in dropdown**

**Check:**
1. Open console → Any errors?
2. Check Network tab → `/api/clubs` call successful?
3. User has permission to manage clubs?

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Add this log in CreateRecruitmentPage.jsx line 38
console.log('My clubs:', myClubs);
console.log('Club memberships:', clubMemberships);
```

---

### **Issue 3: Auto-select not working**

**Check:**
1. User manages only 1 club?
2. Console log shows: `console.log('Managed clubs length:', managedClubs.length);`

**Expected:**
- If 1 club → Auto-select
- If 0 clubs → Show warning
- If 2+ clubs → Manual select

---

### **Issue 4: Backend returns 500 error**

**Check backend terminal for:**
```
Error: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "..." at path "club"
```

**This means:**
- Club ID format is wrong
- Club ID is not a valid ObjectId

**Fix:**
- Check Network payload → `club` field value
- Should be 24 hex characters (like: `67123abc456def789012ghij`)

---

## 🆘 IF ALL TESTS FAIL

**Try these steps:**

1. **Clear everything:**
```bash
# Frontend
cd Frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start

# Backend
cd Backend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start

2. **Check Git status:**
```bash
git status
# Should show modified files:

# - Backend/src/modules/recruitment/recruitment.validators.js
```

3. **Verify code changes:**
- Open `CreateRecruitmentPage.jsx` → Line 94-158 should have new code
- Open `recruitment.validators.js` → Line 11-15 should have custom messages

4. **Check environment:**
- MongoDB running?
- Redis running?
- Correct ports (Backend: 5000, Frontend: 3000)?
