## 🐛 **Known Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: User dropdown empty**
**Cause:** Users not loaded  
**Fix:** Ensure `/api/users` endpoint returns users

### **Issue 2: Permission denied**
**Cause:** User doesn't have admin/core role  
**Check:** Verify JWT token contains correct role

### **Issue 3: Member not appearing**
**Cause:** Status is "pending" not "approved"
