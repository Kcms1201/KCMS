## 💻 CODE CHANGES

### **File: `Frontend/src/pages/reports/ReportsPage.jsx`**

**1. Added Role Constants:**
```javascript
const isAdmin = user?.roles?.global === 'admin';
const isCoordinator = user?.roles?.global === 'coordinator';
const isAdminOrCoordinator = isAdmin || isCoordinator;
```

**2. Filter Clubs for Coordinators:**
```javascript
const fetchClubs = async () => {
  const allClubs = response.data?.clubs || [];
  
  // Coordinators only see clubs they coordinate
  if (isCoordinator && user?.id) {
    const coordinatedClubs = allClubs.filter(club => 
      club.coordinator === user.id || 
      club.coordinator?._id === user.id
    );
    setClubs(coordinatedClubs);
    
    // Auto-select if only one club
    if (coordinatedClubs.length === 1) {
      setSelectedClub(coordinatedClubs[0]._id);
    }
  } else {
    // Admin sees all clubs
    setClubs(allClubs);
  }
};
```

**3. Hide Audit Logs from Coordinators:**
```javascript
{/* Audit Logs - Admin Only */}
{isAdmin && (
  <button
    className={`tab-btn ${activeTab === 'audit' ? 'active' : ''}`}
    onClick={() => setActiveTab('audit')}
  >
    <FaHistory /> Audit Logs
  </button>
)}
```

**4. Added Helper Messages:**
```javascript
{isCoordinator && clubs.length > 0 && (
  <div className="info-message">
    <strong>Note:</strong> You can only generate reports for clubs you coordinate: 
    <strong>{clubs.map(c => c.name).join(', ')}</strong>
  </div>
)}

{isCoordinator && clubs.length === 0 && (
  <div className="warning-message">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> You are not assigned as coordinator to any club. 
    Please contact admin.
  </div>
)}
```
