## 🔗 Backend API Integration

### Authentication Flow
```javascript
1. User logs in → Backend validates credentials
2. Backend returns JWT + user data (with roles)
3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
4. Frontend routes to appropriate dashboard
5. Dashboard fetches data using JWT token
```

### Data Fetching Pattern
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchDashboardData();
}, []);

const fetchDashboardData = async () => {
  try {
    const [data1, data2, data3] = await Promise.all([
      service1.fetch(),
      service2.fetch(),
      service3.fetch()
    ]);
    // Process and display data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};
```

### Token Management
- Access token stored in localStorage
- Automatic refresh on 401 errors
- Request interceptor adds token to headers
- Response interceptor handles token refresh

- **Stats Cards**: Display metrics with icons
- **Action Cards**: Quick action buttons
- **Data Cards**: Club/event/recruitment cards
