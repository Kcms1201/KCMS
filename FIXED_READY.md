# ✅ FIXED! Backend Ready to Show OTP

## What Was Fixed

**File:** `Backend/src/modules/auth/auth.service.js`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Fixed syntax error (missing `await redis.multi()`)
2. ✅ Added console logging for OTP
3. ✅ Made email sending non-blocking (won't crash if email fails)

---

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### When You Register:

**Backend Terminal Will Show:**
```
========================================
🔐 REGISTRATION OTP
========================================
Email: your-email@example.com
OTP Code: 123456
Valid for: 10 minutes
========================================

⚠️ Email sending failed, but OTP is logged above
```

**Or if email works:**
```
========================================
🔐 REGISTRATION OTP
========================================
Email: your-email@example.com
OTP Code: 123456
Valid for: 10 minutes
========================================

✅ Email sent successfully to your-email@example.com
```
