# ✅ COORDINATOR SEARCH BEHAVIOR - FINAL

**Date:** Oct 22, 2025, 12:30 PM  
**Decision:** Coordinators don't need recommendations but can search/view all clubs

---

## 🎯 COORDINATOR SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY

### **What Coordinators CAN Do:**
✅ **Search for ANY club** using the search bar  
✅ **View ANY club's detail page** (events, members, etc.)  
✅ **See all public information** about any club  
✅ **Navigate to any club page** from search results  

### **What Coordinators DON'T See:**
❌ **Recommendations section** (removed - only for students)  
❌ **"Discover clubs" suggestions** (not needed for faculty)  

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### **File: `Frontend/src/pages/search/SearchPage.jsx`**

**Before:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchRecommendations();  // Fetched for ALL users
}, []);
```

**After:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Only fetch recommendations for students, not for coordinators or admins
  const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user') || '{}');
  const isStudent = user?.roles?.global === 'student';
  
  if (isStudent) {
    fetchRecommendations();  // Only for students
  }
}, []);
```
