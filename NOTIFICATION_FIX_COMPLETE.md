# ✅ NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FIXED!

**Date:** Oct 28, 2025, 11:31 AM  
**Issue:** Student didn't receive notification after approval

---

## 🐛 **ROOT CAUSE:**

**Notification model was missing `title` and `message` fields!**

### **What Was Happening:**

**Backend:**
```javascript
// Only stored type and payload
{
  type: 'performer_approved',
  payload: { eventId, eventTitle, ... }
}
```

**Frontend:**
```javascript
// Tried to display title and message
<p>{notif.title || 'New Notification'}</p>
<p>{notif.message}</p>
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Notification was CREATED in database
- ✅ Notification bell showed unread count
- ❌ But displayed as "New Notification" with NO message
- ❌ User couldn't understand what the notification was about

---

## ✅ **FIX APPLIED:**

### **1. Updated Notification Model** ✅

**File:** `Backend/src/modules/notification/notification.model.js`

**Added fields:**
```javascript
title:   { type: String, required: true }, // ✅ Display title
message: { type: String, required: true }, // ✅ Display message
```

---

### **2. Updated Registration Service** ✅

**File:** `Backend/src/modules/event/eventRegistration.service.js`

**Added title/message for approval notification:**
```javascript
const title = decision.status === 'approved'
  ? '✅ Performance Approved!'
  : '❌ Performance Declined';

const message = decision.status === 'approved'
  ? `Your ${performanceType} performance for "${eventTitle}" has been approved by ${clubName}!`
  : `Your ${performanceType} performance for "${eventTitle}" was not approved. Reason: ${reason}`;

await notificationService.create({
  user: student._id,
  type: 'performer_approved',
  title,      // ✅ NEW
  message,    // ✅ NEW
  payload: { ... },
  priority: 'HIGH'
});
```

**Added title/message for registration notification (to presidents):**
```javascript
title: '🎭 New Performance Registration',
message: `A student wants to perform ${performanceType} at "${eventTitle}". Please review and approve.`
```
