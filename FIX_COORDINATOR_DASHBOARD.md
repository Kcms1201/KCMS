# Fix Coordinator Dashboard - Quick Guide

## 🔍 The Problem

Your coordinator dashboard shows:
- ✅ 13 Assigned Clubs (correct count)
- ❌ 0 Pending Approvals (should show events)
- ❌ 0 Total Events (should show count)

## 🎯 Root Cause

You used `assign-membership-roles.js` which only updates **Membership records**.

But the coordinator dashboard needs the **Club.coordinator field** to be set.

**Two separate things:**
1. `Club.coordinator` field → Required for dashboard
2. `Membership` role → Just a membership record

## ✅ The Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Update Coordinator Script

Edit `Backend/scripts/assign-club-coordinators.js`:

```javascript
const COORDINATOR_ASSIGNMENTS = [
  {
    clubName: 'Recurse Coding Club',
    coordinatorRollNumber: '23BD1A1201', // YOUR COORDINATOR
  },
  {
    clubName: 'AALP Music Club',
    coordinatorRollNumber: '23bd1a056Q', // YOUR COORDINATOR
  },
  // Add ALL 13 clubs that should show in dashboard
];
```

### Step 2: Run the Script

```bash
cd Backend
node scripts/assign-club-coordinators.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB

📋 Processing: Recurse Coding Club → 23BD1A1201
   ✅ Successfully assigned user@email.com as coordinator
   📧 User: 23BD1A1201 (user@email.com)
   🏢 Club: Recurse Coding Club

============================================================
📊 ASSIGNMENT SUMMARY
============================================================
✅ Successful assignments: 2
❌ Failed assignments: 0
============================================================
```

### Step 3: Seed Events (Optional - for testing)

```bash
node scripts/seed-events.js
```

This creates:
- 2 events with status `pending_coordinator`
- These will appear in "Pending Approvals"

---

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

1. **Log in as coordinator**
2. **Go to** `/coordinator/dashboard`
3. **You should now see:**
   - ✅ Assigned Clubs: 13 (or your count)
   - ✅ Pending Approvals: 2 (if you ran seed script)
   - ✅ Total Events: Shows actual count
4. **Click "Pending Events"** - events should appear
5. **Click "My Clubs"** - your 13 clubs should be listed

## 📊 What Each Script Does

| Script | What It Updates | Use For |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **assign-club-coordinators.js** ⭐ | Club.coordinator field + Membership | Coordinators (use this!) |
| assign-membership-roles.js | Membership only | Regular members/roles |
| seed-events.js | Events with various statuses | Testing events |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Still shows 0 clubs?

**Check:**
1. Roll numbers match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Club names match exactly
3. User and clubs exist in database
4. Logged in as correct user
5. Clear browser cache

**Debug in MongoDB:**
```javascript
// Check if coordinator field is set
db.clubs.find({ name: "Recurse Coding Club" })

// Should show:
// coordinator: ObjectId("...") ← This should be set
```

### Still shows 0 pending events?

**Reasons:**
1. No events with status `pending_coordinator`
2. Events belong to different clubs

**Solution:**
```bash
# Seed sample events
node scripts/seed-events.js

# This creates 2 events with status 'pending_coordinator'
```
