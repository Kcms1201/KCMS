// Notify club core members about scheduled recruitment
const coreMembers = await Membership.find({
  club: rec.club,
  status: 'approved',
  role: { $in: ['president', 'vicePresident', 'core', 'secretary'] }
}).distinct('user');

await Promise.all(coreMembers.map(uid =>
  notificationService.create({
    user: uid,
    type: 'approval_required',
    payload: { recruitmentId: id, title: rec.title },
    priority: 'HIGH'
  })
));

// Notified ALL approved members (including regular members!)
const cores = await Membership.find({

  status: 'approved' 
}).distinct('user');

```javascript
// Notify only core members about new application
const coreMembers = await Membership.find({
  club: rec.club,

  role: { $in: ['president', 'vicePresident', 'core', 'secretary', 'treasurer'] }
}).distinct('user');
