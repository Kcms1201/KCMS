# ✅ Notification Type Enum Error - FIXED!

## 🎯 Error

```
ValidationError: Notification validation failed: 
type: `performer_registration` is not a valid enum value for path `type`.
```

**When:** Registering for an event as a performer

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

### **The Problem:**

When a student registers as a **performer** for an event, the code tries to notify club presidents with:

```javascript
notificationService.create({
  user: userId,
  type: 'performer_registration',  // ❌ Not in enum!
  payload: { ... }
});
```

### **The Notification Model:**

**File:** `notification.model.js` (Lines 6-10)

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
type: { 
  type: String, 
  enum: [
    'recruitment_open',
    'recruitment_closing',
    'application_status',
    'event_reminder',
    'approval_required',
    'role_assigned',
    'system_maintenance',
    'request_approved',
    'request_rejected',
    'budget_approved',
    'budget_rejected'
  ]
}
```

**Missing types:**
- ❌ `performer_registration`
- ❌ `performer_approved`
- ❌ `performer_rejected`
- ❌ `event_rejected`

---

## ✅ FIX APPLIED

### **Updated Notification Model:**

**File:** `notification.model.js` (Line 10)

**AFTER:**
```javascript
type: { 
  type: String, 
  enum: [
    'recruitment_open',
    'recruitment_closing',
    'application_status',
    'event_reminder',
    'approval_required',
    'role_assigned',
    'system_maintenance',
    'request_approved',
    'request_rejected',
    'budget_approved',
    'budget_rejected',
    'performer_registration',  // ✅ NEW
    'performer_approved',      // ✅ NEW
    'performer_rejected',      // ✅ NEW
    'event_rejected'           // ✅ NEW
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 What Each Type Does

| Notification Type | When Sent | To Whom |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| `performer_registration` | Student registers as performer | Club presidents/vice-presidents |
| `performer_approved` | Registration approved after audition | Student (applicant) |
| `performer_rejected` | Registration rejected | Student (applicant) |
