# 🔧 ERROR FIX: Album Name "undefined - NaN"

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Errors Fixed:** Event data extraction + Album fetching 404

---

## 🐛 **ERRORS IN SCREENSHOT:**

```javascript
📁 Album name: undefined - NaN
Error fetching albums: AxiosError
404 Not Found on /api/clubs/.../documents/albums
❌ Error creating event album: AxiosError
```

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSES:**

### **Issue #1: Event Data Not Extracted**

**Problem:**
```javascript
// WRONG - tried to extract data incorrectly
const eventRes = await eventService.getById(eventIdParam);
const event = eventRes.data || eventRes;

// Backend actually returns: { data: { event: {...} } }
// So eventRes.data = { event: {...} }
// But we were using eventRes.data directly → Got { event: {...} } object
// Then event.title = undefined!
```

**Result:**
- `event.title` = undefined
- `event.dateTime` = undefined  
- Album name = "undefined - NaN"

**Fix:**
```javascript
const eventRes = await eventService.getById(eventIdParam);
// Correct extraction chain
const event = eventRes.event || eventRes.data?.event || eventRes.data || eventRes;

// Validate data
if (!event || !event.title || !event.dateTime) {
  throw new Error('Invalid event data received');
}
```

### **Issue #2: Album Fetch 404 Error**

**Problem:**
- First time accessing gallery for a club
- No albums exist yet
- Backend returns 404
- Frontend crashes trying to use albums

**Fix:**
```javascript
let existingAlbums = [];
try {
  const albumsRes = await documentService.getAlbums(clubIdParam);
  existingAlbums = albumsRes.albums || albumsRes.data?.albums || [];
} catch (albumErr) {
  // If 404, it's OK - means no albums yet
  if (albumErr.response?.status === 404) {
    console.log('ℹ️ No albums yet - will create first album');
    existingAlbums = [];
  } else {
    console.error('⚠️ Error fetching albums:', albumErr.message);
    existingAlbums = [];
  }
}
// Continue with album creation...
```

---

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED:**

### **Fix #1: Correct Event Data Extraction**

**File:** `Frontend/src/pages/media/GalleryPage.jsx`

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
const event = eventRes.data || eventRes;
// Gets { event: {...} } instead of {...}

// AFTER (FIXED)
const event = eventRes.event || eventRes.data?.event || eventRes.data || eventRes;

// Handles all response structures:
// 1. { event: {...} } → eventRes.event
// 2. { data: { event: {...} } } → eventRes.data.event
// 3. { data: {...} } → eventRes.data
// 4. {...} → eventRes
```

---

### **Fix #2: Validate Event Data**

```javascript
if (!event || !event.title || !event.dateTime) {
  throw new Error('Invalid event data received');
}
```

**Prevents:**
- undefined title
- undefined dateTime
- "undefined - NaN" album names

---

### **Fix #3: Handle Album 404 Gracefully**

```javascript
try {
  const albumsRes = await documentService.getAlbums(clubIdParam);
  existingAlbums = albumsRes.albums || albumsRes.data?.albums || [];
  console.log('📚 Existing albums:', existingAlbums.length);
} catch (albumErr) {
  if (albumErr.response?.status === 404) {
    // First time - no albums yet, it's OK!
    existingAlbums = [];
  } else {
    // Other error - log but continue
    console.error('⚠️ Error:', albumErr.message);
    existingAlbums = [];
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Doesn't crash on 404
- ✅ Allows album creation for new clubs
- ✅ Continues even if albums endpoint fails

---

### **Fix #4: Enhanced Debug Logging**

```javascript
console.log('🔄 Auto-creating album for event:', eventIdParam);
console.log('📁 Album name:', albumName);
console.log('📅 Event:', event.title, 'Date:', event.dateTime);
console.log('📂 Fetching albums for club:', clubIdParam);
console.log('📚 Existing albums:', existingAlbums.length);
```

**Helps debug:**
- What data is received
- What album name is generated
- How many existing albums
- Where the process fails

📂 Fetching albums for club: 68xxx
ℹ️ No albums yet - will create first album
✨ Creating new album...
✅ Album created successfully!
```

---

### **Test Case 2: Existing Club (Has Albums)**

1. Navigate from event to gallery
2. Club already has albums

**Expected:**
```
🔄 Auto-creating album for event: 67xxx
📁 Album name: Tech Talk - 2024
📅 Event: Tech Talk Date: 2024-10-18T10:00:00.000Z
📂 Fetching albums for club: 68xxx

## 📊 **BACKEND RESPONSE STRUCTURE:**

### **Event Details Response:**

```javascript
// Endpoint: GET /api/events/:id

2. **Expected console output:**
   ```
   🔄 Auto-creating album for event: 671286...
   📁 Album name: Your Event Name - 2024
   📅 Event: Your Event Name Date: 2024-10-18T...
   📂 Fetching albums for club: 68ea...
   ℹ️ No albums yet - will create first album
   ✨ Creating new album...
   ✅ Album created successfully!
   ```

3. **If still fails:**
   - Check backend logs
   - Verify event exists in database
   - Check user has permission to create albums
   - Ensure club ID is valid

---

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING GUIDE:**

If you see errors, check console logs:

### **"Invalid event data received"**
→ Event not found or missing fields
→ Check: Does event exist? Is it accessible?

### **"404 Not Found"**  
→ Albums endpoint or permission issue
→ Check: Is user logged in? Is user member of club?

### **"Album already exists"**
→ Duplicate album name
→ Expected behavior, should skip creation

### **"Failed to create album"**
→ Backend validation or permission error
→ Check: User has core+ role? Album name valid?

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Test it now!** The event data should extract correctly and album names should display properly! 🎉
