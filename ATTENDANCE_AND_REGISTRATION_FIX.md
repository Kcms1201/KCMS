# ✅ Attendance & Registration Approval - FIXED!

## 🎯 Two Critical Bugs Fixed

### **Issue 1: Attendance Page - Members Not Showing**
### **Issue 2: Cannot Approve/Reject Event Registrations**

---

## 🔍 Issue 1: Attendance Page Not Showing Members

### **Root Cause:**

The frontend was calling the WRONG endpoint to fetch organizers.

**What it did:**
```javascript
// ❌ Called getById and expected organizers in event object
const response = await eventService.getById(eventId);
const organizers = eventData.organizers || [];  // Always empty!
```

**What it should do:**
```javascript
// ✅ Call dedicated organizers endpoint
const response = await eventService.getEventOrganizers(eventId);
const organizers = response.data.organizers;
```

### **Fix Applied:**

**Files Modified:**
1. `Frontend/src/pages/events/OrganizerAttendancePage.jsx` - Updated to call correct endpoint
2. `Frontend/src/services/eventService.js` - Added `getEventOrganizers()` method

**Now the attendance page:**
- ✅ Fetches ALL club members from primary + participating clubs
- ✅ Shows their names, roll numbers, clubs
- ✅ Displays current attendance status (absent/present)
- ✅ Allows marking them present

## 🔍 Issue 2: Cannot Approve/Reject Registrations

### **Root Cause:**

**CRITICAL PERMISSION BUG!**

The code was checking if the user is a leader of the WRONG club!

**Scenario:**
```
Music Club hosts "Annual Concert"
Student from Dance Club registers as performer
```

**BEFORE (WRONG):**
```javascript
// Line 166 - WRONG CLUB CHECK!
const membership = await Membership.findOne({
  club: registration.representingClub._id,  // ❌ Checks Dance Club!
  user: userContext.id,
  role: { $in: ['president', 'vicePresident'] }
});
```

**Result:** Only Dance Club presidents could approve/reject! ❌

**Music Club presidents (who are hosting) couldn't do anything!** ❌

---

### **Fix Applied:**

**File:** `Backend/src/modules/event/eventRegistration.service.js`

**BEFORE:**
```javascript
club: registration.representingClub._id,  // ❌ WRONG!
```

**AFTER:**
```javascript
club: registration.event.club,  // ✅ Event's HOST club!
role: { $in: ['president', 'vicePresident', 'core'] }  // ✅ Added core too
```

**Also fixed audition permission check (Line 378):**
- Same issue - was checking representing club instead of event host club
- Now checks event host club correctly

## 📊 How It Works Now

### **Registration Approval Flow:**

```
Student registers as performer for Music Club's event
    ↓

    ↓
Who can approve/reject?
    ✅ Music Club President
    ✅ Music Club Vice President  
    ✅ Music Club Core Members
    ✅ Admins
    ↓
    ❌ Dance Club leaders (NOT involved in approval!)
```

### **Audition Status Flow:**

```

## 🔑 Key Understanding

**Two Different Club References:**

1. **`registration.representingClub`**
   - The club the STUDENT/PERFORMER represents
   - Example: Dance Club

2. **`registration.event.club`**
   - The club HOSTING THE EVENT
   - Example: Music Club

**Who approves registrations?**
- ✅ The HOSTING club (event.club)
- ❌ NOT the representing club

**This is now fixed!** 🎉

**RESTART BACKEND AND TEST! Both issues resolved! 🚀**
