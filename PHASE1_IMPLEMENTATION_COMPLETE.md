# ✅ Phase 1: Event Status Workflow - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## 🎉 WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Event Model Updates** ✅
**File:** `Backend/src/modules/event/event.model.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `pending_completion` status
- ✅ Added `incomplete` status
- ✅ Added `completionDeadline` field
- ✅ Added `completionReminderSent` object (day3, day5)
- ✅ Added `completionChecklist` object (photos, report, attendance, bills)
- ✅ Added `completedAt`, `markedIncompleteAt`, `incompleteReason` fields

**Impact:** Events now track completion progress with 7-day deadline

---

### **2. Automated Cron Jobs** ✅
**File:** `Backend/src/jobs/eventStatusCron.js` (NEW FILE)

**4 Jobs Created:**

#### **Job 1: Start Ongoing Events** 🎬
- **Schedule:** Every hour (`0 * * * *`)
- **Action:** Changes `published` → `ongoing` on event day
- **Notifications:** Notifies core team that event is live

#### **Job 2: Move to Pending Completion** ⏳
- **Schedule:** Every hour at :30 (`30 * * * *`)
- **Action:** Changes `ongoing` → `pending_completion` 24hrs after event
- **Sets:** 7-day completion deadline
- **Checks:** Auto-completes if all materials already uploaded
- **Notifications:** Sends initial reminder with missing items list

#### **Job 3: Send Completion Reminders** 📧
- **Schedule:** Daily at 9:00 AM (`0 9 * * *`)
- **Day 3 Reminder:** "⏰ 4 days left! Still need: [items]"
- **Day 5 Reminder:** "🚨 URGENT: 2 days left! Upload or mark incomplete"
- **Recipients:** Core team + Coordinator

#### **Job 4: Mark Incomplete Events** ❌
- **Schedule:** Daily at 10:00 AM (`0 10 * * *`)
- **Action:** Changes `pending_completion` → `incomplete` after 7 days
- **Sets:** `incompleteReason` with list of missing items
- **Notifications:** Alerts core team + coordinator
- **Audit:** Logs the incomplete status change

---

### **3. Server Integration** ✅
**File:** `Backend/src/server.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Registered cron jobs in startup sequence
- ✅ Logs "📅 Event Status Cron Jobs: Running" on startup
- ✅ Only runs if `START_SCHEDULERS=true` in config

---

### **4. Frontend Status Badges** ✅
**File:** `Frontend/src/pages/events/EventDetailPage.jsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `pending_completion` badge (⏳ orange/warning)
- ✅ Added `incomplete` badge (❌ red/danger)
- ✅ Changed `completed` badge color to green (success)
- ✅ Custom labels with emojis for better visibility

---

## 🔄 NEW EVENT LIFECYCLE

### **Complete Workflow:**
```
CREATION & APPROVAL:
draft → pending_coordinator → pending_admin → approved → published

EVENT DAY:
published → ongoing (✅ Auto-changed by Job 1 - every hour)

POST-EVENT (7-DAY GRACE PERIOD):
ongoing → pending_completion (✅ Auto-changed by Job 2 - 24hrs after event)
  │
  ├─ Day 1: Initial reminder sent to core team
  ├─ Day 3: "4 days left" reminder (✅ Job 3)
  ├─ Day 5: "URGENT: 2 days left" reminder (✅ Job 3)
  └─ Day 7: Check completion status (✅ Job 4)

COMPLETION:
pending_completion → completed (✅ All materials uploaded)
                  └→ incomplete (❌ 7 days passed, missing items)

FINAL:
completed/incomplete → archived
```

---

## 📋 COMPLETION CHECKLIST LOGIC

### **Auto-tracked Items:**
1. ✅ **Photos:** Minimum 5 uploaded
2. ✅ **Report:** Event report URL present
3. ✅ **Attendance:** Attendance sheet URL present
4. ✅ **Bills:** Bills uploaded (only if budget > 0)

### **Auto-completion:**
If ALL items are uploaded when Job 2 runs, event auto-changes to `completed`

### **Manual Upload:**
Club can still upload materials during 7-day period. On next cron run, if checklist complete → auto-mark as `completed`

---

## 🧪 TESTING GUIDE

### **Test 1: Auto-Start Ongoing Events**

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `status: 'published'`
2. Set `dateTime` to current time or 1 hour ago
3. Wait for next hour (or trigger manually)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Status changes to `ongoing`
- ✅ Core team receives notification
- ✅ Console logs: "Event marked as ongoing"

**Manual Trigger (for testing):**
```javascript
// In backend, temporarily change cron schedule to run every minute for testing
cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => { // Every minute instead of every hour
```

---

### **Test 2: Move to Pending Completion**

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `status: 'ongoing'`
2. Set `dateTime` to 25+ hours ago
3. Wait for next :30 hour (e.g., 9:30, 10:30)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Status changes to `pending_completion`
- ✅ `completionDeadline` set to `dateTime + 7 days`
- ✅ `completionChecklist` populated with current status
- ✅ If incomplete, reminder sent to core team
- ✅ If complete, auto-changes to `completed`

**Check in Database:**
```javascript
db.events.findOne({ status: 'pending_completion' })
// Should have:
// - completionDeadline: Date
// - completionChecklist: { ... }
```

---

### **Test 3: Completion Reminders**

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `status: 'pending_completion'`
2. Set `completionDeadline` to 4 days from now (for Day 3 reminder)
3. Ensure `completionReminderSent.day3 = false`
4. Wait for 9:00 AM next day

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Core team receives "4 days left" notification
- ✅ `completionReminderSent.day3` set to `true`
- ✅ Console logs: "Day 3 reminder sent"

**For Day 5 Reminder:**
- Set `completionDeadline` to 2 days from now
- Ensure `completionReminderSent.day5 = false`
- Wait for 9:00 AM
- ✅ Receives "URGENT: 2 days left" notification
- ✅ Coordinator also notified

---

### **Test 4: Mark Incomplete**

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `status: 'pending_completion'`
2. Set `completionDeadline` to yesterday
3. Set some checklist items to `false`
4. Wait for 10:00 AM next day

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Status changes to `incomplete`
- ✅ `markedIncompleteAt` set to current date
- ✅ `incompleteReason` contains list of missing items
- ✅ Core team + coordinator notified
- ✅ Audit log created
- ✅ Console logs: "Event marked as incomplete"

---

### **Test 5: Auto-Complete**

**Setup:**
1. Create event with `status: 'ongoing'`
2. Set `dateTime` to 25+ hours ago
3. **Upload all materials BEFORE cron runs:**
   - 5+ photos
   - Event report URL
   - Attendance sheet URL
   - Bills (if budget > 0)
4. Wait for Job 2 (:30 hour)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Status changes directly from `ongoing` → `completed`
- ✅ Skips `pending_completion` status
- ✅ `completedAt` timestamp set
- ✅ Console logs: "auto-completed (all materials uploaded)"

---

### **Test 6: Frontend Status Display**

**Setup:**
1. Open event detail page
2. Test with events in different statuses

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ `pending_completion`: Orange badge with "⏳ PENDING COMPLETION"
- ✅ `incomplete`: Red badge with "❌ INCOMPLETE"
- ✅ `completed`: Green badge with "COMPLETED"
- ✅ Other statuses: Display correctly as before

---

## 🚀 HOW TO START

### **Step 1: Restart Backend**

```bash
cd c:\Users\Jasmi\OneDrive\Desktop\club14\KCMS\Backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Console Output:**
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Redis connected successfully
📅 Event Status Cron Jobs: Running
🔄 Event Status Cron Jobs - Initializing...
✅ Event Status Cron Jobs - Initialized Successfully!
📅 Job 1: Start ongoing events - Every hour
📅 Job 2: Move to pending_completion - Every hour at :30
📅 Job 3: Send reminders - Daily at 9:00 AM
📅 Job 4: Mark incomplete - Daily at 10:00 AM
🚀 Server started successfully!
```

---

### **Step 2: Verify Cron Jobs Are Running**

**Check Console Logs:**
- Every hour (on the hour): `🔄 [Cron Job 1] Checking for events to mark as ongoing...`
- Every hour (at :30): `🔄 [Cron Job 2] Checking events to move to pending_completion...`
- Daily at 9:00 AM: `🔄 [Cron Job 3] Sending completion reminders...`
- Daily at 10:00 AM: `🔄 [Cron Job 4] Checking for incomplete events...`

---

### **Step 3: Test with Real Event**

**Quick Test (Immediate Results):**

1. **Create Test Event:**
```javascript
// Via MongoDB or API
POST /api/events
{
  "title": "Test Event - Auto Status",
  "club": "your_club_id",
  "dateTime": new Date(Date.now() - 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 2 hours ago
  "status": "published",
  "description": "Testing auto-status workflow",
  "venue": "Test Hall"
}
```

2. **Manually Trigger Job (for instant testing):**
```javascript
// In eventStatusCron.js, temporarily change:
cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => { // Run every minute
  // Job 1 code...
});
```

3. **Watch Console:**
```
🔄 [Cron Job 1] Checking for events to mark as ongoing...
   ✅ Event "Test Event - Auto Status" marked as ongoing
   ✅ [Job 1] Completed - 1 event(s) started
```

4. **Wait 2 minutes, check Job 2:**
```
🔄 [Cron Job 2] Checking events to move to pending_completion...
   ⏳ Event "Test Event - Auto Status" moved to pending_completion
```

## 📊 MONITORING

### **Database Queries:**

**Check pending completion events:**
```javascript
db.events.find({ 
  status: 'pending_completion' 
}).pretty()
```

**Check incomplete events:**
```javascript
db.events.find({ 
  status: 'incomplete' 
}).pretty()
```

**Check completion checklist:**
```javascript
db.events.findOne({ 
  status: 'pending_completion' 
}, { 
  title: 1, 
  completionChecklist: 1, 
  completionDeadline: 1,
  completionReminderSent: 1
})
```

**Check audit logs:**
```javascript
db.audits.find({ 
  action: 'EVENT_MARKED_INCOMPLETE' 
}).sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(5)
```

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: Cron Jobs Not Running**

**Cause:** `START_SCHEDULERS` not set to `true`

**Solution:**
```bash
# In Backend/.env
START_SCHEDULERS=true
```

---

### **Issue: Status Not Changing**

**Check:**
1. ✅ Event `dateTime` is in the past
2. ✅ Event has correct current status
3. ✅ Cron job is running (check console logs)
4. ✅ No errors in console

**Manual Check:**
```javascript
// In backend console
const { Event } = require('./src/modules/event/event.model');

// Find events that should be ongoing
Event.find({
  status: 'published',
  dateTime: { $lt: new Date() }
}).then(events => console.log('Should be ongoing:', events.length));
```

---

### **Issue: Notifications Not Sent**

**Check:**
1. ✅ Core members exist in club
2. ✅ Notification service working
3. ✅ Check notification logs in console
4. ✅ Check notifications collection in database

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
