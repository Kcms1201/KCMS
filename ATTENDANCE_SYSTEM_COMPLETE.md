# ‚úÖ ATTENDANCE SYSTEM - FULLY FIXED

**Date:** Oct 28, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved

---

## üéØ **ISSUES FIXED:**

### **1. No Organizers Showing (FIXED ‚úÖ)**
**Problem:** Page showed "No organizers assigned to this event"  
**Root Cause:** Response data path was wrong - accessing `data.data.organizers` instead of `data.organizers`  
**Fix:** Changed `organizersResponse.data?.data?.organizers` to `organizersResponse.data?.organizers`

### **2. Failed to Mark Attendance (FIXED ‚úÖ)**
**Problem:** Error "clubId is required for this operation"  
**Root Cause:** Using wrong endpoint (QR attendance endpoint instead of organizer attendance endpoint)  
**Fix:** 
- Created new service method `updateOrganizerAttendance`
- Changed endpoint from `/attendance` to `/organizer-attendance`
- Updated validator to accept array directly
- Updated controller to use array format

### **3. Validation Error "must be of type object" (FIXED ‚úÖ)**
**Problem:** Joi validation rejecting request body  
**Root Cause:** Validator expected object wrapper but received array directly  
**Fix:**
- Changed validator from `Joi.object({ attendance: Joi.array()... })` to `Joi.array()...`
- Updated controller to use `req.body` directly (it's the array)
- Updated frontend to send array directly without wrapper

### **4. CSV Export Forbidden (FIXED ‚úÖ)**
**Problem:** Club presidents couldn't download attendance CSV  
**Root Cause:** CSV export required coordinator/admin permissions  
**Fix:** Changed permission from `requireCoordinatorOrAdmin()` to `requireAssignedCoordinatorOrClubRoleForEvent(['core', 'vicePresident', 'president'])`

---

## üìã **FILES MODIFIED:**

### **Backend:**
1. `Backend/src/modules/event/event.validators.js`
   - Added `organizerAttendance` validator (array format)

2. `Backend/src/modules/event/event.routes.js`
   - Added validator to organizer-attendance route

3. `Backend/src/modules/event/event.controller.js`
   - Updated `updateOrganizerAttendance` to use `req.body` directly

4. `Backend/src/modules/reports/report.routes.js`
   - Changed CSV export permission to allow club leaders
   - Imported `requireAssignedCoordinatorOrClubRoleForEvent`

### **Frontend:**
1. `Frontend/src/services/eventService.js`
   - Added `updateOrganizerAttendance` method
   - Sends array directly (not wrapped in object)

2. `Frontend/src/pages/events/OrganizerAttendancePage.jsx`
   - Fixed data path from `data.data.organizers` to `data.organizers`
   - Updated to use new `updateOrganizerAttendance` method
   - Removed all debug console logs
