## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Making Documents Look Professional:**
1. **Add Logo**: Include KMIT logo at the top
2. **Use Headers/Footers**: Add page numbers, event name
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Use same font throughout (Calibri 11 or Arial 12)
4. **Tables**: Use tables for budget breakdown (easier to read)
5. **Bold Important Info**: Highlight dates, amounts, requirements
6. **Spell Check**: Always run spell checker before saving

### **File Naming Convention:**
```
Good Examples:
- Dance_Fest_Proposal_March2025.pdf
- Cultural_Event_Budget_Breakdown.pdf
- Auditorium_Permission_15Mar2025.pdf

Bad Examples:
- proposal.pdf (too generic)
- doc1.pdf (not descriptive)
- new document.pdf (has spaces)
```

### **Compressing PDFs (if too large):**
