## 🔗 INTEGRATION ANALYSIS

### ✅ Well-Linked Pages:

1. **Auth Flow:** Register → OTP → Profile → Login → Dashboard ✓
2. **Club Flow:** List → Details → Settings → Members ✓
3. **Recruitment Flow:** Create → Applications → Review → Selection ✓
4. **Event Flow:** Create → Approval → RSVP → Details ✓
5. **Media Flow:** Upload → Gallery → Albums → Display ✓

### ⚠️ Poorly Linked Pages:

1. **Reports:** No navigation from dashboard
2. **Search:** Results don't link back to context
3. **Notifications:** No deep linking to source
4. **Admin:** Settings isolated from main flow

### ❌ Missing Links:

1. Dashboard → Quick actions (no direct event create)
2. Club Detail → Budget view (exists but hidden)
3. Event → Photo upload (no direct link post-event)
4. Profile → Notification preferences (no page)

**Solution:** 10 photo limit + Google Drive link support
