## 🔴 Current Errors Explained

### 1. Registration 409 Error ✅ EXPECTED
**Error:** `POST /api/auth/register - 409 Conflict`

**What it means:** 
- You already registered with this email/roll number
- This is NORMAL behavior, not a bug

**What to do:**
- Use the **Login** page instead
- Or register with a different email/roll number

**Status:** ✅ Working as designed

---

### 2. Login 403 Error ⚠️ ACTION NEEDED
**Error:** `POST /api/auth/login - 403 Forbidden`

**What it means:**
- Either wrong credentials, OR
- Account not verified (OTP not completed)

**What to do:**
1. If you just registered: **Complete OTP verification first**
   - Check your email for OTP code
   - Go to verify-otp page
   - Enter the 6-digit code

2. If you already verified: **Check your credentials**
   - Make sure email/roll number is correct

### 3. Events API 500 Error 🐛 BACKEND BUG
**Error:** `GET /api/events?limit=4&status=published - 500 Internal Server Error`

**What it means:**
- Backend events API has a bug
- Could be empty database or code error

**Impact:**
- HomePage won't show events
- But app still works fine
- Already handled gracefully (shows empty instead of crashing)

**What to do:**
- Nothing! Frontend handles it gracefully
- Backend needs to be fixed (not a frontend issue)

**Status:** 🐛 Backend issue, frontend working correctly
