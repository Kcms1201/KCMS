# 🔐 FIX: 403 Forbidden - Gallery Permission Issue

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Gallery viewing restricted to club members only

---

## 🐛 **THE PROBLEM**

**Error in Console:**
```
403 Forbidden on:
- GET  /api/clubs/:clubId/documents/albums
- GET  /api/clubs/:clubId/documents
- POST /api/clubs/:clubId/documents/albums
```

**Root Cause:** Gallery routes required club membership to VIEW, but gallery should be **publicly accessible** to all students!

---

## 🔍 **PERMISSION ISSUE**

### **Routes Were Too Restrictive:**

**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
// Get Albums
router.get('/albums',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin', 'coordinator'], ['member', 'core', 'president']),
  //                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //                                       Only club members could view!
  ctrl.getAlbums
);

// List Documents
router.get('/',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin', 'coordinator'], ['member', 'core', 'president']),
  //                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  //                                       Only club members could view!
  ctrl.list
);
```

**Problem:**
- Students who are NOT members of the club got 403 Forbidden
- Gallery should be viewable by ALL authenticated users
- Only UPLOAD should be restricted to core members

---

## ✅ **THE FIX**

### **Made Gallery Viewing Public:**

**File:** `Backend/src/modules/document/document.routes.js`

**1. Public Gallery Viewing:**
```javascript
// List / Gallery - Public viewing for all authenticated users
router.get(
  '/',
  authenticate, // ✅ All authenticated users can view
  validate(v.clubIdParam, 'params'),
  validate(v.listSchema, 'query'),
  ctrl.list
);
```

**2. Public Album Listing:**
```javascript
// Get Albums - Public viewing for all authenticated users
router.get(
  '/albums',
  authenticate, // ✅ All authenticated users can view albums
  ctrl.getAlbums
);
```

**3. Public Photo Downloads:**
```javascript
// Download Original - Public download for all authenticated users
router.get(
  '/:docId/download',
  authenticate, // ✅ All authenticated users can download
  validate(v.docIdParam, 'params'),
  ctrl.download
);
```

**4. Public Search:**
```javascript
// Search Documents - Public search for all authenticated users
router.get(
  '/search',
  authenticate, // ✅ All authenticated users can search
  validate(v.searchSchema, 'query'),
  ctrl.searchDocuments
);
```

**5. Public Download URLs:**
```javascript
// Get Download URL - Public download URLs for all authenticated users
router.get(
  '/:docId/download-url',
  authenticate, // ✅ All authenticated users can get URLs
  validate(v.docIdParam, 'params'),
  ctrl.getDownloadUrl
);
```

---

## 🔒 **WHAT'S STILL RESTRICTED**

### **Upload Operations (Core Members Only):**

**1. File Upload:**
```javascript
router.post('/upload',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin'], CORE_AND_PRESIDENT), // ✅ Admin OR Core+President
  ctrl.upload
);
```

**2. Album Creation:**
```javascript
router.post('/albums',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin'], CORE_AND_PRESIDENT), // ✅ Admin OR Core+President
  ctrl.createAlbum
);
```

**3. Bulk Upload:**
```javascript
router.post('/bulk-upload',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin'], CORE_AND_PRESIDENT), // ✅ Admin OR Core+President
  ctrl.bulkUpload
);
```

**4. Delete Document:**
```javascript
router.delete('/:docId',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin'], PRESIDENT_ONLY), // ✅ Admin OR President ONLY
  ctrl.delete
);
```

**5. Tag Members:**
```javascript
router.patch('/:docId/tag',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin'], CORE_AND_PRESIDENT), // ✅ Admin OR Core+President
  ctrl.tagMembers
);
```

**6. Analytics:**
```javascript
router.get('/analytics',
  authenticate,
  requireEither(['admin', 'coordinator'], ['core', 'president']), // ✅ Admin/Coordinator OR Core+
  ctrl.getAnalytics
);
```

## 📊 **PERMISSION SUMMARY**

### **Public (All Authenticated Users):**

✅ View gallery photos  
✅ View albums  
✅ Download photos  
✅ Search documents  
✅ Get download URLs  

### **Core Members Only:**

🔒 Upload photos  
🔒 Create albums  
🔒 Bulk upload  
🔒 Tag members  
🔒 View analytics  

### **Leadership Only:**

🔒 Delete documents (President/Admin only)  

---

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MAKES SENSE**

**Gallery Philosophy:**
- Events are public → Photos should be public
- All students attend events → All students can view photos
- Only organizers upload → Upload restricted to core members
- Album creation → Auto-created by system for events

**Security Benefits:**
- Authentication still required (prevents anonymous access)
- Upload operations properly restricted
- Deletion limited to leadership
- Analytics protected (sensitive data)

---

## 🔄 **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **BEFORE (Broken):**

```
Student (not club member) tries to view gallery:
  ↓
GET /api/clubs/:clubId/documents/albums
  ↓
requireEither(['admin', 'coordinator'], ['member', 'core', 'president'])
  ↓
User is NOT member of club
  ↓
403 Forbidden ❌
```

### **AFTER (Fixed):**

```
Student (not club member) tries to view gallery:
  ↓
GET /api/clubs/:clubId/documents/albums
  ↓
authenticate (user is logged in)
  ↓
200 OK - Albums returned ✅
```

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **Step 1: Restart Backend**

```bash
cd Backend
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm start
```

**Expected:**
```
🚀 Server started successfully!
📡 Server listening on port: 5000
```

### **Step 2: Test Gallery Viewing (as any student)**

**Console should show:**
```
📂 Fetching albums for club: 68ea61b322570c47ad51fe5c
📚 Existing albums: 1
✅ Album created successfully! (or "Album already exists")
```

**No more 403 errors!** ✅

---

## 📝 **NOTICE FROM LOGS**

**Good News!** Looking at your console logs:
```
409 Conflict: "Album already exists"
✅ Album created successfully!
```

**The album WAS created!** The 403 error happened AFTER one successful creation. So your album "Navaraas - 2025" exists in the database!

After restarting backend with fixed permissions, you should be able to:
1. View the album
2. See it in the albums list
3. Upload photos to it (if you have core role)

---

## 📋 **FILES MODIFIED**

**Backend (1 file):**

1. **`Backend/src/modules/document/document.routes.js`** (Lines 28-113)
   - Removed permission checks from GET routes
   - Made gallery viewing public
   - Kept upload operations restricted

**Changes:**
- ✅ GET `/` - Public
- ✅ GET `/albums` - Public
- ✅ GET `/:docId/download` - Public
- ✅ GET `/search` - Public
- ✅ GET `/:docId/download-url` - Public
- 🔒 POST `/upload` - Core+ only (unchanged)
- 🔒 POST `/albums` - Core+ only (unchanged)
- 🔒 DELETE `/:docId` - President only (unchanged)

---

## ✅ **WHAT'S FIXED**

✅ All students can view gallery  
✅ All students can see albums  
✅ All students can download photos  
✅ All students can search documents  
✅ Upload still restricted to core members  
✅ Album creation still restricted to core members  
✅ Deletion still restricted to leadership  

---

1. Navigate to Gallery page
2. Should see albums list (no 403!)
3. Should see photos (no 403!)
4. If you're core member → Upload button visible
