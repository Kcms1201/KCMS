## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I didn't receive the OTP email"

**Check:**
1. Spam/Junk folder
2. Email address is correct: chowpavithra48@gmail.com
3. Backend terminal for OTP (if email bypass is enabled)

**If using email bypass:**
Look at the Backend terminal for a line like:
```
🔐 OTP for chowpavithra48@gmail.com : 123456
```

### "I can't find the verify-otp page"

**Direct Link:**
http://localhost:3000/verify-otp

Or click "Verify OTP" from the navigation

### "Login still shows 403 error"

This means you haven't completed OTP verification yet.
**Solution:** Complete steps 1-4 above first.
